 * Password - a type defining a user password

 * This struct has only one field. We hide this field into struct, so it 
 * cannot be accessible from outside. We define only operations on password:
 * Get, Set and Cmp (compare) to arbitrary string. From outside we deal with
 * strings, while internally everything is done using bytes.
 * Also, when password is set, it is hashed and stored that way. All operations
 * on passwords are performed using hashed passwords.
